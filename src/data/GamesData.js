It is the eleventh major installment, and 21st overall, in the Assassin's Creed series and the successor to 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and (in Japan only) for Nintendo Switch on October 5, 2018, with a Stadia version launching alongside the service in 2019. The game received generally favorable reviews.

      "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and is a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. The story is set in 1899 in a fictionalized representation of the Western, Midwestern, and Southern United States and follows outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang. Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The story also follows fellow gang member John Marston, the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption. The game is presented through both first and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, heists, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system similar to the 'wanted' system from the Grand Theft Auto franchise governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. Red Dead Redemption 2 was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2018, and for Microsoft Windows and Stadia in November 2019. Red Dead Online, the online multiplayer mode of the game, was released as a beta version in November 2018 before a full release in May 2019.",

It is scheduled to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 19 November 2020, Stadia by the end of the year, and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021.

Both lethal and non-lethal playthroughs are possible. Cyberpunk 2077 is being developed using the REDengine 4 by a team of around 500, exceeding the number that worked on the studio's previous game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. CD Projekt launched a new division in Wrocław, Poland and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, and QLOC to assist with production. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith is a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The soundtrack features music by Marcin Przybyłowicz, P. T.

      "Half-Life: Alyx is a 2020 virtual reality (VR) first-person shooter developed and published by Valve. Between the events of Half-Life (1998) and Half-Life 2 (2004), players control Alyx Vance on a mission to seize a superweapon belonging to the alien Combine. Players use VR to interact with the environment and fight enemies, using 'gravity gloves' to manipulate objects, similarly to the gravity gun from Half-Life 2. Traditional Half-Life elements return, such as physics puzzles, combat, exploration and survival horror aspects. The last Half-Life game, Episode Two, was released in 2007. After abandoning plans for a third Half-Life episode, Valve began experimenting with VR in the mid-2010s, recognizing the demand for a large-scale VR game. They experimented with prototypes using their various IP, such as Portal, and found that Half-Life best suited VR. Alyx entered full production using Valve's new Source 2 engine in 2016, with the largest team in Valve's history. Alyx was released for Windows on March 23, 2020, with support for most PC-compatible VR headsets. It received acclaim for its graphics, voice acting, writing, and atmosphere, and was cited by some as VR's first killer app. Valve released a Linux version in May 2020.",

      "The Last of Us Part II is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. Set five years after The Last of Us (2013), players control 19-year-old Ellie, who comes into conflict with a mysterious cult in a post-apocalyptic United States. The game contains survival horror elements and is played from a third-person perspective. Players can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against enemies and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The six-year development of Part II began in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Remastered. Neil Druckmann returned as creative director, while Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose the score. The game was announced in December 2016 and delayed twice, first for further development and then due to logistical problems arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released on June 19, 2020, and received a near universally positive critical response. Praise was directed at the improved gameplay over its predecessor and visual fidelity, while its plot and the presentations of its themes through violence received a polarized response.",
